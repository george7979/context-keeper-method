# Context Keeper Method (CKM)

> **Keep context, kill chaos** ‚Äì Your AI never "forgets" what you're building

**Context Keeper Method (CKM)** is a universal documentation framework for AI-assisted work that solves **context loss between sessions**. Whether you're developing products, managing change, conducting research, or improving operations, CKM preserves work continuity across AI sessions through a WHAT-WHEN-HOW framework: PRD (what & why), PLAN (when), and TECH (how).
