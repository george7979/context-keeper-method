# Context Keeper Method (CKM)

> **Keep context, kill chaos** ‚Äì Your AI never "forgets" what you're building

**Context Keeper Method (CKM)** is a universal documentation framework for AI-assisted work that solves **context loss between sessions**. Whether you're developing products, managing change, conducting research, or improving operations, CKM preserves work continuity across AI sessions through a WHAT-WHEN-HOW framework: PRD (what & why), PLAN (when), and TECH (how).

## ‚ö° Quick Start

```bash
# Create the 3 core documents
touch PRD.md     # Requirements & objectives (WHAT & WHY)
touch PLAN.md    # Timeline and priorities (WHEN)
touch TECH.md    # Implementation approach (HOW)

# Add tool extensions if needed
touch CLAUDE.md  # AI assistant instructions (when using Claude Code)
```
