# Context Keeper Method (CKM) - Universal Documentation Framework for AI-Assisted Work

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 2025
**Author:** Jerzy Mączewski
**Purpose:** Universal documentation framework for AI-assisted work across any domain - projects, change management, research, operations

---

## 📋 Executive Summary

This document defines the **Context Keeper Method (CKM)** - a universal **documentation framework for AI-assisted work** that separates objectives (WHAT), timeline planning (WHEN), and implementation approach (HOW). Applicable to product development, change management, research, operations, or any work requiring persistent AI context. Additional tool-specific documents like CLAUDE.md are added when using specific tools.

## 📌 Why "Context Keeper Method"?

When working with AI assistants (like Claude Code), the biggest challenge is **context loss between sessions**. You find yourself repeatedly explaining the same project details, requirements, and technical decisions to your AI collaborator.

CKM solves this by maintaining **strategic documentation** that:
- **Preserves project continuity** across AI sessions
- **Eliminates repetitive explanations** - AI can quickly understand project context
- **Evolves with your project needs** - documentation stays relevant
- **Currently uses 3 core documents**, but adapts as methodology evolves
- **Keeps context, kills chaos** - your AI never "forgets" what you're working on

**Core principle:** Document just enough to maintain context, nothing more. Be lazy, but smart about it.

---

## 🧠 Context Engineering Alignment

CKM implements **context engineering** principles - the systematic practice of structuring information to optimize AI collaboration. Unlike traditional prompt engineering (per-request optimization), CKM creates persistent context systems that serve as reliable AI memory across sessions, eliminating the need to repeatedly explain project details.

### Core Philosophy
**Context Preservation + Enhanced Separation of Concerns** - CKM methodology consists of:

#### Core Documents (Required for all work):
- Stakeholders focus on **PRD** (what & why)
- Managers focus on **PLAN** (when & priorities)
- Implementers focus on **TECH** (how & execution)

#### Tool-Specific Extensions (Added when using specific tools):
- **CLAUDE.md** - When using Claude Code (AI assistant instructions)

#### Post-Completion Documentation:
- **README.md** - End-user documentation (created after project completion)

### Document Structure

#### 1️⃣ PRD.md - Project Requirements Document
**Purpose:** Define WHAT we're achieving and WHY

**Content:**
- **Problem Statement** - What problem or opportunity are we addressing?
- **Stakeholder Requirements** - Who are affected and what do they need?
- **Objectives** - Why is this important for the organization?
- **Functional Requirements** - What capabilities must be included?
- **Non-functional Requirements** - Performance, quality, compliance standards
- **Acceptance Criteria** - How do we know when it's complete?
- **Constraints & Assumptions** - Limitations and dependencies
- **Success Metrics** - How do we measure success?

**Format:** See [PRD-template.md](./templates/PRD-template.md) for complete structure and examples.

#### 2️⃣ PLAN.md - Implementation Plan & Timeline
**Purpose:** Define WHEN things will be done and in what order

**Content:**
- **Project Phases** - Major stages of development
- **Timeline** - Start/end dates, milestones
- **Task Breakdown** - Detailed task lists per phase
- **Priorities** - P0 (critical), P1 (important), P2 (nice-to-have)
- **Dependencies** - What needs to be done before what
- **Resource Allocation** - Who's doing what
- **Risk Management** - Potential issues and mitigation
- **Daily/Weekly Goals** - Specific deliverables

**Format:** See [PLAN-template.md](./templates/PLAN-template.md) for complete structure and examples.

#### 3️⃣ TECH.md - Technical & Implementation Document

## 🎯 Separation of Concerns Guidelines

### Maintaining Clear Document Boundaries

One of the most critical aspects of CKM is maintaining strict separation between document purposes. Each document answers a single fundamental question and should not overlap with others.

### DO's and DON'Ts for Each Document

#### 📋 PRD.md - Business Focus (WHAT & WHY)

✅ **DO Include:**
- Business requirements and objectives
- Stakeholder needs and user stories
- Problem statements and context
- Success metrics and KPIs
- Constraints and assumptions
- Risk analysis from business perspective
- Acceptance criteria

❌ **DON'T Include:**
- Source code or code snippets
- File paths or line numbers
- Technical implementation details
- System architecture diagrams
- Deployment commands or procedures
- Timeline information (reference PLAN.md)

#### 📅 PLAN.md - Timeline Focus (WHEN)

✅ **DO Include:**
- Project phases and milestones
- Task breakdown and dependencies
- Resource allocation and responsibilities
- Risk mitigation timeline
- Priority levels (P0, P1, P2)
- Daily/weekly goals and deliverables
- Communication and stakeholder management

❌ **DON'T Include:**
- Technical architecture details
- Code examples or API specifications
- Business justifications (reference PRD.md)
- Temporary documentation as deliverables
- Implementation procedures (reference TECH.md)

#### 🔧 TECH.md - Implementation Focus (HOW)

✅ **DO Include:**
- System architecture and design
- Code organization and file structure
- API specifications and integrations
- Technical procedures and commands
- Performance metrics and benchmarks
- Known issues and solutions
- Development guidelines and patterns

❌ **DON'T Include:**
- Business rationale (reference PRD.md)
- Project timeline (reference PLAN.md)
- User requirements (reference PRD.md)
- Success metrics from business perspective
- Stakeholder communication plans

### Cross-Reference Strategy

**Instead of duplicating content:**
- ✅ "Implementation details in TECH.md Section 3.2"
- ✅ "Business rationale documented in PRD.md"
- ✅ "Timeline impact assessed in PLAN.md Phase 2"

**Avoid redundant explanations:**
- ❌ Copying the same technical details to multiple documents
- ❌ Re-explaining business justification in technical docs
- ❌ Duplicating timeline information across documents

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

#### 1. **Temporary Documentation Mixing**
- **Issue:** Creating transitional docs (like MODIFICATIONS.md) and treating them as CKM deliverables
- **Solution:** Keep temporary docs separate, migrate content to appropriate CKM document, then delete

#### 2. **Boundary Blurring**
- **Issue:** Adding code snippets to PRD.md "for clarity"
- **Solution:** Reference TECH.md section instead, maintain strict boundaries

#### 3. **Content Duplication**
- **Issue:** Same information appearing in multiple documents
- **Solution:** Single source of truth principle - each piece of information lives in exactly one document

#### 4. **Scope Creep**
- **Issue:** Documents trying to be "complete" rather than focused
- **Solution:** Each document serves its specific audience with targeted information

### Pre-Finalization Checklist

Before finalizing your CKM documentation, verify:

#### Document Boundaries:
- [ ] No code snippets in PRD.md
- [ ] No architecture details in PLAN.md
- [ ] No business justifications in TECH.md
- [ ] No timeline information in PRD.md or TECH.md

#### Cross-References:
- [ ] All cross-references are accurate and specific
- [ ] No duplicated content between documents
- [ ] Each piece of information has single source of truth

#### Quality Checks:
- [ ] Each document answers its core question (WHAT/WHEN/HOW)
- [ ] Temporary documentation has been removed or migrated
- [ ] Document serves its intended audience effectively

**Remember:** Clean separation of concerns prevents documentation debt and ensures each document serves its specific purpose effectively.
