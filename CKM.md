# Context Keeper Method (CKM) - Universal Documentation Framework for AI-Assisted Work

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 2025
**Author:** Jerzy MƒÖczewski
**Purpose:** Universal documentation framework for AI-assisted work across any domain - projects, change management, research, operations

---

## üìã Executive Summary

This document defines the **Context Keeper Method (CKM)** - a universal **documentation framework for AI-assisted work** that separates objectives (WHAT), timeline planning (WHEN), and implementation approach (HOW). Applicable to product development, change management, research, operations, or any work requiring persistent AI context. Additional tool-specific documents like CLAUDE.md are added when using specific tools.

## üìå Why "Context Keeper Method"?

When working with AI assistants (like Claude Code), the biggest challenge is **context loss between sessions**. You find yourself repeatedly explaining the same project details, requirements, and technical decisions to your AI collaborator.

CKM solves this by maintaining **strategic documentation** that:
- **Preserves project continuity** across AI sessions
- **Eliminates repetitive explanations** - AI can quickly understand project context
- **Evolves with your project needs** - documentation stays relevant
- **Currently uses 3 core documents**, but adapts as methodology evolves
- **Keeps context, kills chaos** - your AI never "forgets" what you're working on

**Core principle:** Document just enough to maintain context, nothing more. Be lazy, but smart about it.

## üß† Context Engineering Alignment

CKM implements **context engineering** principles - the systematic practice of structuring information to optimize AI collaboration. Unlike traditional prompt engineering (per-request optimization), CKM creates persistent context systems that serve as reliable AI memory across sessions, eliminating the need to repeatedly explain project details.

## üìö The CKM Core System + Tool Extensions

### Core Philosophy
**Context Preservation + Enhanced Separation of Concerns** - CKM methodology consists of:

#### Core Documents (Required for all work):
- Stakeholders focus on **PRD** (what & why)
- Managers focus on **PLAN** (when & priorities)
- Implementers focus on **TECH** (how & execution)

#### Tool-Specific Extensions (Added when using specific tools):
- **CLAUDE.md** - When using Claude Code (AI assistant instructions)

#### Post-Completion Documentation:
- **README.md** - End-user documentation (created after project completion)

### Document Structure

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ PRD.md - Project Requirements Document
**Purpose:** Define WHAT we're achieving and WHY

**Content:**
- **Problem Statement** - What problem or opportunity are we addressing?
- **Stakeholder Requirements** - Who are affected and what do they need?
- **Objectives** - Why is this important for the organization?
- **Functional Requirements** - What capabilities must be included?
- **Non-functional Requirements** - Performance, quality, compliance standards
- **Acceptance Criteria** - How do we know when it's complete?
- **Constraints & Assumptions** - Limitations and dependencies
- **Success Metrics** - How do we measure success?

**Format:** See [PRD-template.md](./templates/PRD-template.md) for complete structure and examples.

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ PLAN.md - Implementation Plan & Timeline
**Purpose:** Define WHEN things will be done and in what order

**Content:**
- **Project Phases** - Major stages of development
- **Timeline** - Start/end dates, milestones
- **Task Breakdown** - Detailed task lists per phase
- **Priorities** - P0 (critical), P1 (important), P2 (nice-to-have)
- **Dependencies** - What needs to be done before what
- **Resource Allocation** - Who's doing what
- **Risk Management** - Potential issues and mitigation
- **Daily/Weekly Goals** - Specific deliverables

**Format:** See [PLAN-template.md](./templates/PLAN-template.md) for complete structure and examples.

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ TECH.md - Technical & Implementation Document
**Purpose:** Define HOW we implement and execute the work

**Content:**
- **Architecture Overview** - System design and structure

**Format:** See [TECH-template.md](./templates/TECH-template.md) for complete structure and examples.

**Key TECH.md principles:**
- **For developers**: Main reference point for technical team
- **Currency**: Always reflects current system state
- **Specificity**: Real technologies, not abstractions
- **Solutions**: Describes how to solve known issues

#### ü§ñ CLAUDE.md - AI Assistant Instructions (Claude Code Extension)
**Purpose:** Guide Claude Code's behavior with this repository
**Note:** This document is specific to Claude Code usage and is not part of the core CKM methodology

**Content:**
- **Project Overview** - Brief project context
- **Document References** - Links to PRD, PLAN, TECH files
- **Coding Standards** - Naming conventions, patterns
- **Tool Preferences** - Preferred commands and tools
- **Security Rules** - What never to commit or expose
- **Testing Commands** - How to run tests and checks
- **Git Workflow** - Branch strategy, commit guidelines
- **Common Tasks** - Frequently performed operations

**Note:** CLAUDE.md structure is defined by Claude Code documentation.

#### üìñ README.md - User Documentation (Post-Completion)
**Purpose:** End-user guide created AFTER project completion
**Note:** This is documentation for end users, not part of the core project methodology

**Content:**
- Installation instructions
- Usage examples
- API documentation
- Configuration options
- Troubleshooting guide
